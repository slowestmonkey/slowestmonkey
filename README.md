### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mark

Currently, I'm working as a Backend Engineer, mainly with `node.js`, hmmm what else... :P

Nah, I'll better describe myself with some random things I like:
- investigating application <strong>architectures</strong> and talking about them
- <strong>FP</strong> principles
- finding a personal balance in life (work, exercising, developing and learning in a spare time, developing self-awareness improving the mental state)
- guidelines/explanations wrapped up [here](https://github.com/Sairyss/domain-driven-hexagon)
- dates, I'm even eating a few while writing this :D
- seems like I'm into <strong>Go</strong> now, so let me know if have something I can be useful
- gifs, music (indie, alternative, metal, punk) and movies, a lot of movies...
